# üÉè JOKER - Java pOKER Calculator

[![Javadoc](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaDoc-Online-green)](https://davideck123.github.io/joker-calc/docs)

**Joker calculator** is a 7-card Texas Hold'em poker odds calculator and evaluator.  
The evaluator is a Java port of [PokerHandEvaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator) by [HenryRLee](https://github.com/HenryRLee), 
which contains [a detailed explanation](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/blob/master/Documentation/Algorithm.md) of the hand evaluation algorithm.
The calculator then evaluates all combinations of cards that are left in the deck, and calculates the probability of each player winning/splitting.

## Build
To use the joker calculator from the command line, simply run `mvn clean package` to build the jar and then you can use the `./joker` command in the top level directory.

## Usage
Cards are specified as card aliases (two character strings), where the first character is the rank 
`2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, A` and the second character is the suit `c, d, h, s` for clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades respectively.  

Specify the players' cards as space seperated card aliases, e.g. `Ah 4d` for A‚ô•Ô∏è (Ace of Hearts) and 4‚ô¶Ô∏è (Four of Diamonds), 
`2c Ts` for 2‚ô£Ô∏è (Deuce of Clubs) and 10‚ô†Ô∏è (Ten of Spades), etc.

Optionally specify the board cards as space seperated card aliases, e.g. `-b 2c Ts 4d 5h` 
for 2‚ô£Ô∏è (Deuce of Clubs), 10‚ô†Ô∏è (Ten of Spades), 4‚ô¶Ô∏è (Four of Diamonds) and 5‚ô•Ô∏è (Five of Hearts) as the turn etc.

Optionally specify the dead cards (the cards that are no longer in the deck) as space 
seperated card aliases, e.g. `-d Tc 2c` for 10‚ô£Ô∏è (Ten of Clubs) and 2‚ô£Ô∏è (Deuce of Clubs).

```
./joker -h
Usage: joker [-ehV] [-b=<card>]... [-d=<card>]... (<card> <card>)...
      (<card> <card>)...   Player cards (2 cards per player, 2 to 10 players).
  -b, --board=<card>       Board cards - flop, turn or river (3 to 5 cards).
  -d, --dead=<card>        Cards that are no longer in the deck (1 to 19 cards).
  -e, --emoji              Display emojis for suits instead of letters.
  -h, --help               Show this help message and exit.
  -V, --version            Print version information and exit.
```

Also, you can use the `-e` flag to display emojis for suits instead of letters.
```
./joker Jh 9s Ac 2d --emoji
        Win     Tie
J‚ô•Ô∏è9‚ô†Ô∏è:  43,82%   0,43%
A‚ô£Ô∏è2‚ô¶Ô∏è:  55,75%   0,43%
```

## Examples

Player 1 has A‚ô•Ô∏è (Ace of Hearts) and KÔ∏è‚ô•Ô∏è (King of Hearts),  
player 2 has Q‚ô£Ô∏è (Queen of Clubs) and Q‚ô¶Ô∏è (Queen of Diamonds),  
player 3 has 7‚ô£Ô∏è (Seven of Clubs) and 7‚ô¶Ô∏è (Seven of Diamonds)  
and the board is 3‚ô¶Ô∏è (Three of Diamonds), 5‚ô£Ô∏è (Five of Clubs) and K‚ô£Ô∏è (King of Clubs).  
The scenario is represented as follows: `Ah Kh Qc Qd 7c 7d -b 3d 5c Kc`  

```
./joker Ah Kh Qc Qd 7c 7d -b 3d 5c Kc
        Win     Tie
AhKh:  76.41%   0.00%
QcQd:  13.18%   0.00%
7c7d:  10.41%   0.00%
```

Player 1 has A‚ô£Ô∏è (Ace of Clubs) and 8‚ô†Ô∏è (Eight of Spades),  
player 2 has 5‚ô£Ô∏è (Five of Clubs) and 8‚ô•Ô∏è (Eight of Hearts),  
player 3 has 7‚ô¶Ô∏è (Seven of Diamonds) and K‚ô¶Ô∏è (King of Diamonds)  
and the dead cards are K‚ô•Ô∏è (King of Hearts) and 2‚ô£Ô∏è (Deuce of Clubs).  
The scenario is represented as follows: `Ac 8s 5c 8h 7d Kd -d Kh 2c`

```
./joker Ac 8s 5c 8h 7d Kd -d Kh 2c
        Win     Tie
Ac8s:  45.69%   2.22%
5c8h:  16.90%   2.22%
7dKd:  35.20%   0.29%
```
