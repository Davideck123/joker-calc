# üÉè Joker - (Java) Poker Calculator

**Joker calculator** is a 7-card Texas Hold'em poker odds calculator and evaluator.  
The evaluator is a Java port of [PokerHandEvaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator) by [HenryRLee](https://github.com/HenryRLee), 
which contains [a detailed explanation](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/blob/master/Documentation/Algorithm.md) of the hand evaluation algorithm.
The calculator then evaluates all combinations of cards that are left in the deck, and calculates the probability of each player winning/splitting.

## Usage
Cards are specified as card aliases (two character strings), where the first character is the rank 
`2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, T, J, Q, K, A` and the second character is the suit `c, d, h, s` for clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades respectively.  

Specify the players' cards as space seperated card aliases, e.g. `Ah 4d` for A‚ô•Ô∏è (Ace of Hearts) and 4‚ô¶Ô∏è (Four of Diamonds), 
`2c Ts` for 2‚ô£Ô∏è (Two of Clubs) and T‚ô†Ô∏è (Ten of Spades), etc.

Optionally specify the board cards as space seperated card aliases, e.g. `-b 2c Ts 4d 5h` 
for 2‚ô£Ô∏è (Two of Clubs), T‚ô†Ô∏è (Ten of Spades), 4‚ô¶Ô∏è (Four of Diamonds) and 5‚ô•Ô∏è (Five of Hearts) as the turn etc.

Optionally specify the dead cards (the cards that are no longer in the deck) as space 
seperated card aliases, e.g. `-d 10c 2c` for 10‚ô£Ô∏è (Ten of Clubs) and 2‚ô£Ô∏è (Two of Clubs).
